Add a DATABASE - Mongo

rename classes folder yaf



Warning: require_once(/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/yaf/rules/loaders/loader.main.php) [function.require-once]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/yaf/com/classes/interface/Page.php on line 75

Fatal error: require_once() [function.require]: Failed opening required '/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/yaf/rules/loaders/loader.main.php' (include_path='.:/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5.3/lib/php') in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/yaf/com/classes/interface/Page.php on line 75

install xdebug

change config to JSON or XML - no classes

this can't happen when the page does not exist:
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 40 bytes) in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/samplesTogetherLite/com/andre/dao/Basedao.php on line 56

improvements:
get pages out of database (annoying when versioning and developing)


cool/features:
edit content right from the page (content could be versioned too)
add the server-side form validator as a library
add the form protection code (the timer from www.samplestogether.com)

The point of YAF should be that it's fast

so it should have a built-in optimization code
